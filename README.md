# M64x4-Dino-Run
MINIMAL DINO RUN is an endless runner based on Google Chrome’s "Dinosaur Game". The original game was created by Sebastien Gabriel, Alan Bettes, and Edward Jung in 2014.

I tried to develop a port fairly faithful to the original game, taking into consideration the Minimal 64x4 limitations. The program is based solely on my observations of the game maechanics, so it can behave slightly differently; however, it is still a dynamic action game that progressively gets harder and faster. To achieve smooth, arcade-like gameplay and the best experience, an expansion board is required. This enables raster-exact animation and utilizes a joystick for optimal control.

You can use the NoExp version to check out the game graphics and basic mechanics on a bare Minimal 64x4 with a keyboard or an emulator, but I highly recommend playing the full version on real hardware using a joystick and, preferably, a CRT monitor. Nothing beats that!

Game requirements:
- Joystick
- Minimal 64x4 computer by Slu4 (v1.1 only) https://github.com/slu4coder/Minimal-64x4-Home-Computer 
- Expansion board by Hans61 https://github.com/hans61/Minimal-64x4-Expansion

Limitations and shortcuts taken:
- No sound implemented
- Every jump is a high jump 
- Pteros fly at the same speed as the ground (should fly faster)
- Please note that this software will only work on revision 1.1 of the Minimal 64x4, as revision 1.4 Redux is not software backward-compatible.

Change log:
- 2025.12.13 v0.9 Initial working emulator firendly preview (no sound, no expansion needed, keyboard controlled).
- 2025.12.17 v1.0 Full version with frame exact animations and joystick support (no sound)
