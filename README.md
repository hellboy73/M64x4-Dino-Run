# M64x4-Dino-Run
MINIMAL DINO RUN is an endless runner based on Google Chrome’s "Dinosaur Game". The original game was created by Sebastien Gabriel, Alan Bettes, and Edward Jung in 2014.

I tried to develop a fairly faithful port of the original game, taking into consideration the Minimal 64x4 limitations. The program is based solely on my observations of the game, so it behaves slightly differently; however, it is still a dynamic action game that progressively gets harder and faster. To achieve smooth, arcade-like gameplay and the best experience, an expansion card is required. This enables raster-exact animation and utilizes a joystick for optimal control.

You can use the NoExp version to check out the game graphics and basic mechanics on a bare Minimal 64x4 with a keyboard or an emulator, but I highly recommend playing the full version on real hardware using a joystick and, preferably, a CRT monitor.

Please note that this software will only work on revision 1.1 of the Minimal 64x4, as revision 1.4 Redux is not software backward-compatible.
